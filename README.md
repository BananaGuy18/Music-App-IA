<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was created and developed as part of my IA (Internal Assessment) for the International Baccalaureate program. The guidelines were to aquire a 
client which required a solution for their problem. In my case my client was a Founder of a music label which they needed a mobile application in order to release their music, collect user feedback and have a controlled environment in terms of what music gets shown to users and such. 

The project also requried a success critera which can be seen below:
* Admin accounts are able to add songs
* Error handling
* Displaying different songs on the "Feed" page upon refresh
* To be able to upvote & downvote songs
* To be able to leave a comment on the song
* Login & Register system
